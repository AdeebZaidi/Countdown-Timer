The Countdown Timer App is a JavaScript-based web application that allows users to input an end time or specific duration (in seconds, minutes, hours, or days) and displays a countdown. The app dynamically updates the time remaining in days, hours, minutes, and seconds and visually represents the progress with a stylish progress bar.

Built using vanilla JavaScript, this app focuses on providing a user-friendly experience through advanced CSS features, input validation, and smooth UI transitions. It also supports quick input submission by pressing the "Enter" key and provides hover effects for enhanced interactivity.



**Key Features:**

- **Time Input Flexibility:** Users can enter a specific date or just seconds, minutes, hours, or days for the countdown.
  
- **Live Countdown:** Displays remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
  
- **Progress Bar:** A beautiful, animated progress bar visually indicates the time left.
  
- **Interactive Button:** Button colors and borders change with hover effects for a sleek user experience.
